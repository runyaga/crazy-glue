  Welcome to the Brainstorm Arena!

  Enter any challenge or problem, and watch four AI brainstormers attack it from different angles:

  - **Practical Pete** - Realistic, actionable ideas
  - **Wild Card Wendy** - Creative, unconventional thinking
  - **Contrarian Carl** - Challenges assumptions, reverse thinking
  - **Analytical Alex** - Data-driven, optimization-focused

  After generating ideas, they vote on each other's suggestions to surface the best ones.

suggestions:
  - "Ways to make morning commutes more enjoyable"
  - "How to stay focused while working from home"
  - "Creative uses for empty office buildings"
  - "Ideas for reducing food waste at restaurants"
  - "Ways to make exercise more fun for people who hate gyms"
  - "How to make online meetings less boring"
