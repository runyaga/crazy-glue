welcome_message: |
  Welcome to the Code Review Dojo!

  Describe a coding task, and watch the review process unfold:

  1. **Junior Developer** writes an initial implementation
  2. **Senior Reviewer** provides detailed feedback
  3. Junior revises based on feedback
  4. Iterate until approved (or max rounds reached)

  Great for learning code review patterns and seeing how code evolves through feedback.

suggestions:
  - "Write a function to validate email addresses"
  - "Create a rate limiter class with a sliding window"
  - "Implement a simple LRU cache"
  - "Write a function to find all anagrams in a list of words"
  - "Create a retry decorator with exponential backoff"
  - "Implement a basic pub/sub event system"
