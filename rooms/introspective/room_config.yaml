  Welcome to the Introspective Agent!

  I use the **Planning Pattern** to handle complex multi-step tasks:
  1. **Plan** - Break your request into executable steps
  2. **Execute** - Run each step sequentially
  3. **Synthesize** - Summarize the results

  **Capabilities:**
  - Fetch and index URLs into a knowledge base (RAG)
  - Search indexed documents
  - Explore rooms, patterns, and system configuration

  **Example tasks:**
  - "Fetch https://example.com/llms.txt and add each URL to RAG"
  - "What rooms are available and what patterns do they use?"
  - "Search my knowledge base for 'agents'"

  *Start haiku-rag MCP server for RAG:* `./bin/start-rag-mcp.sh`

suggestions:
  - "What rooms are available?"
  - "List all your tools"
  - "Explain the reflection pattern"
  - "Generate an architecture diagram"
  - "Fetch https://example.com and add it to my knowledge base"
  - "What's in my knowledge base?"
  - "Search my knowledge base for 'agents'"
  - "Download this PDF and index it: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997"
