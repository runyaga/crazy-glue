  Welcome to the Introspective Agent!

  I'm a self-aware AI that can explore and explain this very soliplex installation.
  I have **16 powerful tools** at my fingertips to inspect the system:

  **Room Tools**
  - List all rooms in the installation
  - Inspect any room's full configuration
  - See example prompts for each room

  **Configuration Tools**
  - View installation settings
  - Check environment variables
  - List configured secrets

  **Pattern Tools**
  - Explain agentic design patterns
  - Find which rooms use which patterns
  - Generate architecture diagrams

  **System Tools**
  - Run health checks
  - Inspect factory agents
  - Learn about myself (meta!)

  Ask me anything about this installation!

suggestions:
  - "What rooms are available in this installation?"
  - "Tell me about yourself - who are you?"
  - "Explain the parallelization pattern and show which rooms use it"
  - "Generate an architecture diagram of this installation"
  - "What's the configuration for the Shark Tank room?"
  - "Run a health check on the system"
  - "What agentic patterns are demonstrated here?"
  - "List all your tools and what they do"
