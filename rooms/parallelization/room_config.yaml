description: "Three concurrent execution strategies: /sectioning (divide work), /voting (consensus), /mapreduce (aggregate)"
welcome_message: |
  Choose a parallelization strategy:

  **/sectioning** Topic: Section1, Section2, Section3
  Divides work into parallel sections, then synthesizes results.

  **/voting** Your question here?
  Runs multiple agents in parallel and aggregates by majority vote.

  **/mapreduce** doc1:text|doc2:text|doc3:text
  Maps documents to parallel summarizers, then reduces to combined summary.

  - "/voting Is functional programming better than OOP for concurrent systems?"
  - "/mapreduce report1:Sales increased 20% in Q3|report2:New product launch successful|report3:Customer satisfaction at all-time high"
