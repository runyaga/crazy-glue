  Welcome to the Shark Tank! 🦈

  Pitch your startup idea and face our panel of sharks:

  - **🎯 Marina Market** - The Market Maven (obsesses over TAM and timing)
  - **🔧 Trevor Tech** - The Tech Titan (evaluates technical defensibility)
  - **💰 Morgan Money** - The Money Mogul (focuses on unit economics)
  - **⚠️ Rita Risk** - The Risk Ranger (identifies threats and red flags)

  Each shark will analyze your pitch in their area of expertise, then decide whether to invest!

  **How it works:**
  1. 📋 Your pitch is broken down into key areas
  2. 🔍 All 4 sharks analyze simultaneously
  3. 💵 Each shark makes their investment decision
  4. 🏆 Final verdict: Funded or No Deal!
