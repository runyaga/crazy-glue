welcome_message: |
  Welcome to Thought Candidates!

  This room uses **Best-of-N sampling** to explore multiple approaches to your problem.

  **How it works:**
  1. Your problem is given to N parallel generators (fast model)
  2. Each candidate is evaluated by a critic (strong model)
  3. Candidates are ranked by score and the best is selected

  **Good for:**
  - Problems with multiple valid solutions
  - When you want to compare approaches
  - Self-consistency checks on reasoning

  **Not ideal for:**
  - Simple queries that single-shot handles well
  - Purely subjective tasks (no scoring criteria)
  - Tight latency/cost budgets (2N LLM calls)

  Enter any problem, question, or challenge to explore!
