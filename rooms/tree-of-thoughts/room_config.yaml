welcome_message: |
  Welcome to Tree of Thoughts!

  This room uses **beam search** to explore a tree of reasoning paths.

  **How it works:**
  1. Generate root candidates for your problem
  2. Expand the best branches (beam search)
  3. Prune low-scoring paths
  4. Synthesize the best path into a solution

  **Good for:**
  - Diagnostic reasoning ("why is X happening?")
  - Multi-step planning
  - Problems where greedy approaches fail
  - Architecture decisions

  **Not ideal for:**
  - Open-ended chat or creative writing
  - Simple queries single-shot handles well
  - Tight latency budgets (10-100x slower)
  - Tasks without evaluable correctness criteria

  Enter a complex problem to explore deeply!

suggestions:
  - "A web app is responding slowly. Response times increased from 200ms to 3s. What are the likely causes?"
  - "How should I migrate from a monolith to microservices?"
  - "Design a fault-tolerant distributed cache system"
  - "What's the best architecture for a real-time collaborative editor?"
  - "Debug: Users report intermittent 500 errors but logs show no exceptions"
